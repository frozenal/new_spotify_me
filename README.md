## What is this?

---

This is a receration of the now defunct Spotify-run statistics page titled spotify.me This is not a 1:1 perfect recreation, as I do not have access to all of the data that Spotify uses. However, I attempted to recreate the main sections of spotify.me, and added a top 10 section.

All credit goes to Spotify for the idea and design. This is a personal project, not made for profit or public use.

## Built with

- ReactJS
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styles
